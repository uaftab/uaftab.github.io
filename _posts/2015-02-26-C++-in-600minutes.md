title: Getting off the ground with C - Part 0
---


We will be covering the basics of C/C++. First things first if you dont have a compiler setup to follow then you can follow along with the tutorial on using : 

{% highlight js %}
#include <stdio.h>

// *.dsw - project workspace

// look at the C-tutorial on my web site

// main is the name of the main program block
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{ // beginning of function

	int integer1;  // declare an integer

	integer1 = 888*2; 

	printf("integer1 = %d\n",integer1);

	// print out hello world and end-of-line character
	printf("Hello World!\n");

	return 0; // end of the program block (function)

} // end of function

For every program there is a `main` function which is the entry point for the program when it is executed. All of the statments in this `main` function are executed sequentially in the order written.

Lets run something first then discuss what it does. The following code can also be used as boilerplate code. 

### Code
{% highlight c %}
/*

// Comments in C/C++
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf( "I am alive!  Beware.\n" );
    getchar();
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Copy the code into a new project. 

Hit the Compile and Execute Button.

Lets take a look at the elements of our program

The `#include` is called a pre-processor directive. 

Just a fancy way of saying that it tells the compiler to include the code from the specificed file into our program. 

This allows us to use to access methods, functions from different files and libraries that we may want to use. Also we can break up our program into multiple files for better code orgranization and readability. We will take a look later in this tutorial on how to use multiple files. 

`#include<stdio.h>` allows us access to input output functions (get it ? stdANDARD iNPUT oUTPUT) like `printf()` and `getchar()` among others. A list of all the functions is available [here] (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/) 

The next important line is `int main()` this is the decleration for the main function i.e. the entry point for the program. This line tells the compiler that there is a function named main, and that the function returns an integer, hence int. The "curly braces" ({ and }) signal the beginning and end of functions and other code blocks. 

On a side note if you are using C++ then you can also use `void main()` eliminating the need to return an exit code on exit. 

The `printf()` function is a way to display text on the screen. It will display what is in the quotes literall as-is on the screen ; well most of the time. [Heres](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) a cheatsheet for formatting the output using printf

`getchar()` function is used to input a **single** character from the keyboard. Its return type is a `char` which can be stored in a variable. 

`getch()` also performs the same function but you need to add `#include<conio.h>`

`kbhit()` is also another function that you will see in the examples provided, it waits for an input event, but this function is not a part of C itself it is a part of the compiler so it may not be avaliable on every system an example for it can be found [here](https://github.com/uaftab/MECH-663-472-C-Examples/blob/master/kbhit.cpp)

The next line is `return 0`. When it reaches this statment it exits the program, in the start we defined `int` as the return type for the `main` function. Here `0` is the called the exit code for the program. There can be multiple exit points in your prgoram and it can exit with different codes to indicate exit state.

##printf() Examples
{% highlight c %}
/* printf example */
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   printf ("Characters: %c %c \n", 'a', 65);
   printf ("Decimals: %d %ld\n", 1977, 650000L);
   printf ("Preceding with blanks: %10d \n", 1977);
   printf ("Preceding with zeros: %010d \n", 1977);
   printf ("Some different radices: %d %x %o %#x %#o \n", 100, 100, 100, 100, 100);
   printf ("floats: %4.2f %+.0e %E \n", 3.1416, 3.1416, 3.1416);
   printf ("Width trick: %*d \n", 5, 10);
   printf ("%s \n", "A string");
   return 0;
}
