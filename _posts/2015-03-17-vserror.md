## rtapi.h is missing

If you are get this error, this means that it cant find `rtapi.h`

This maybe that it is not in your system path or in your project directory (folder).  

Make sure that `rtapi.h` is first in your project folder.

If it is not there the file can copied from this path on your system `C:\Program Files\Ardence\RTX SDK\include` copy all of the files from this location to your project folder. 

Now since the file is located in your folder than the system path change all references to `#include"Rtapi.h"`

For the `include` pre-processor directive `" "` indicates a file in the project folder than the system path.

Hit compile. 

Now you will get this error. 

## LINK ERROR rtapi_w32.lib

`rtapi.h` links to RTX via the `rtapi_w32 library`. 

No worries we just need to tell the linker where the library is so it can link to it. 

First we go into `Tools` then `Options`
