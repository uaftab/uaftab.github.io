## Who I am 

Currently I am pursuing my Masters at Concordia University, Montreal QC, Canada in ECE at the Embedded Systems Lab as a Researcher where I look into different ways of modelling embedded systems at various abstraction levels and GPUs specifically for GPGPU for pre-silicon evaluation for scheduling and power management policies.

Before that I did my bachelors from National University of Science and Technology â€“ SEECS, Islamabad Pakistan in Electrical Engineering.

Some know me from my Senior Design Project, Heuristic Bowling Machine based Cricket Training System which won the Rectors Gold Medal for EE Class of 2013.

## Things I do 

To coalesce it into a few words I tinker,make and build things.

I have built a variety of things from a bowling machine, solar trackers, to mobile apps, web designs to short films and 3d Models.
